# AstroShare Blog

AstroShare Blog is a fictional blog posting news site where information on astronomically related topics can be discussed and verified users can blog posts. There are a number of categories to choose from. There is a comments section below each post. The idea is basically to create the ultimate space blog and discussion center for enthusiasts, experts and curious minds alike! Here users can post, read and comment on the latest news stories about space exploration, astronomy and much more. Each post is tagged by topic, making it easy to navigate through categories like 'Astronomy', 'Space Emissions', 'Astrophysics' and more. Posts can be voted up or down, with the most engaging content highlighted. Users can also leave comments on posts to join the conversation. Every post and comment is timestamped, which promotes real-time discussions and builds a vibrant, interactive community around space topics.

A live version of the project can be accessed here: [AstroShare Blog](https://astroshare-blog-6a7ca9d34749.herokuapp.com/)

## User Stories and Epics
Astro Blog Share is for those who are interested in Astronomical subjects and like to share there toughs in a deticated blog. The blog can be used as a discussion platform for anybody who have a special affliation whit astronomy.




A user story is an explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories were created with the help of GitHub issues. Each user story contains:
* Title - Short description of the user story. 
* Description - As a **role** i can **capability** so that **received benefit**.
* Acceptance criteria - A set of conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the user. 
* Unit tasks - A break down of each task needed to complete user story. 
* A MoSCoW label - To prioritise tasks. 
* Assignee -  Who the user store is assigned too. 
* Milestone - Which epic this user store is associated with.
<br/>


I used an Agile methodology approach to plan this project. This was implemented through the GitHub Project board with milestones, epics, user stories and tasks.
Each user story was classified with a label according to MoSCoW prioritization.<br>
The Kanban board can be seen [here](https://github.com/users/Harmonica-Men/projects/10).

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment
This site was deployed to and is currently [hosted on the Heroku platform](https://mysimpleblog-1c6e9d449421.herokuapp.com/). The steps for deploying to Heroku, using PostgreSQL as the database host, are as follows:

#### Create a new PostgreSQL Code Institute database.

From codeinstitute every student can maintain up to eight databases to run there projects. Here is a step by step guide to install PostgreSQL from Code Institute to the cloud!

  1. Navigate to [PostgreSQL from Code Institute](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net//) and input with your LMS account
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step1](static/images/readme-images/001.png)

  2. After you filled in your LMS account the PostgresSQL database manager will automatically generate a new database for you.
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step2](static/images/readme-images/002.png)

  3. You now have a brand new PostgreSQL Code Institute database
  The link to this database and how to manage all your other databases will be sent to my email. 
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step3](static/images/readme-images/003.png)
  4. **Note:** These databases are limited in time and have a life time of operation of 18 months after the date of creation.
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step4](static/images/readme-images/004.png)
  5. infoknop
  6. copy/paste url-link
  7. paste this in  your env.py & heroku varibles.
 
#### Deploy the project 
  In the previous topic, I have created a PostgreSQL database. In this topic, you are challenged to deploy your project to Heroku.
  First you go to the Heroku website and login whit your credentials. 

  0. Set up your Heroku account 
  ...



  
  Part 1 - Create the Heroku app:
  1. Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name in a GDPR region Europe 
  Note: No Django static file collection will be required during the build.
  2. In your new app’s settings tab, ensure the **Config Vars** click on **Reveal Config Vars** button to define new variables in the inputs fields: 
    
    "DATABASE_URL", "<your-database-URL>"

    "SECRET_KEY", "<secret-key>"

    "CLOUDINARY_URL", "<cloudinary-URL>"


  Part 2 - Update your code for deployment:

  1. Use **pip3** to install ```gunicorn~=20.1``` and **freeze** it to the **requirements.txt** file.
  The commands at the terminal are:

    pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1 
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

  2. In the **Procfile**, add a command using **gunicorn** and **myblog wsgi** file to start the webserver.

  3. In the **myblog/settings.py** file, set the **DEBUG** constant to False and append the **'.herokuapp.com'** hostname to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** list. 
  
    web: gunicorn myblog.wsgi

  **Note:** There is a space after the colon.
  **Note:** The Procfile has no file extension.

  **Top tip!** It's a good habit to always set **DEBUG** to **False** before any deployment. Once you have completed deployment, you can set it back to True locally to continue development.
  **Double check**
    Have you changed DEBUG to False and added , **'.herokuapp.com'** to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS**?
      
      DEBUG = False
      ,'.herokuapp.com'
    
  4. Git add, commit and push the code to your GitHub repo.

    git add .
    git commit -m "readies code for deploy"
    git push origin main


Part 3 - Deploy to Heroku:

  1. In your new app’s **Deploy** tab, search for your GitHub repo and connect it to the Heroku app. Manually deploy the **main** branch of this GitHub repo is also the prefered method.
  **Note:** Start typing your project repo name into the search box and click on the GitHub repo you want to deploy from.
  After manually deploying the main branch, you can view the build output in the application’s **Activity** tab in the dashboard.

  In your new app’s resources tab, ensure you are using an eco dyno and delete any Postgres database Add-on.

  2. Click **Open app** buttin to see your deployed app. 
  If everythings goes well you on the frontpage of myblog.

  **Note:** The build must be complete before you can open the app.

import os

os.environ.setdefault(
    "DATABASE_URL", "<your-database-URL>")
os.environ.setdefault(
    "SECRET_KEY", "(j(j_+@%s$a955-5gw=m@b-%#$slmv$0aixrck&odnq*h+ig@0")
os.environ.setdefault(
    "CLOUDINARY_URL", "<cloudinary-URL>")

## Testing

### HTML Validation

All pages have been passed through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) successfully save for a few minor issues which have been left 'as is' as attempts to correct them proved unsuccessful and lead to results which devalued the user experience. Specifically, these were:

- The use of a 'background' attribute in the body tag of base.html. The validator suggested to replace this with CSS but attempts to do so meant the background image failed to load
- The use of iframe styling attributes on the location.html page. Again, the validator suggested CSS replacements but these caused the map to display incorrectly and almost be unreadable



We ensured that the HTML structure of AstroBlog adheres strictly to web standards. We utilized the W3C Validator to validate our HTML code, striving to minimize and eliminate all possible errors. There are many templates to consider but the main pages where is the focus of stite are the Homepage and the Frontpaga-Blogpost.
After experimenting whit different container layout and fixing all the issues validation results showed **zero errors**.

The detail of these test can evaluate on this link.

            alt="Valid CSS!" />
    </a>
</p>

The CSS of AstroBlog has been carefully crafted and validated to ensure it adheres to the highest standards. I utilized the W3C CSS Validator to check for any errors, and I'm pleased to report that our stylesheets passed with **zero errors**.

This thorough validation process ensures that the user interface is both visually appealing and fully compliant with modern web standards. We took particular care to validate our responsive design elements to ensure consistency across all devices.

Here’s the validation result:

### Accessibility

Ensuring accessibility is a key priority for XemiJobs. We've taken great care to make sure our platform is inclusive and usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities or the devices they are using.

Throughout the development process, we adhered to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to guarantee that our site meets accessibility standards. This includes:

- **Proper use of ARIA attributes:** We have utilized ARIA attributes effectively to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and interactive elements, ensuring screen readers can accurately convey the information to users.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements, including forms, buttons, and navigation links, are fully accessible via keyboard navigation, making the site usable without a mouse.
- **Contrast Ratios:** We carefully selected our color scheme to ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, making the content readable for users with visual impairments.
- **Alt Text for Images:** All images include descriptive `alt` attributes, providing context to users who rely on screen readers.

These efforts help ensure that our site is not only compliant with accessibility standards but also provides an inclusive user experience. We continue to monitor and improve the accessibility of XemiJobs as we develop new features and enhancements.

### Wave Validation

I have conducted a thorough accessibility audit using the WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool). There is a smooth transition between the header of the page and the rest of the main page. Nevertheless, there are some issues to address due to the background MPEG replay. WAVE is dynamic and cannot make a persistent measurement of background contrast.

I have also identified contrast issues with the modal buttons, which follow a similar color pattern to the Flash Danger alerts. However, the inclusion of shadow effects and other design enhancements significantly aids visibility. I believe these design choices ensure the buttons remain accessible and visually clear, even if they do not fully meet WAVE’s contrast recommendations.

Additionally, contrast warnings were noted in the Flash messages—interestingly, all colors except yellow were flagged. While we understand that white text on a yellow background might pose a readability challenge, WAVE does not flag it as an issue. Conversely, other colors, which do not seem problematic to us, were marked for contrast errors.

Overall, the WAVE validation confirms that our website adheres to accessibility standards, with only a few minor contrast issues that have been carefully considered in the design process. While we will continue exploring potential solutions to these issues, we have prioritized maintaining a visually cohesive and intuitive theme for the site.

Note: I'm fully aware of the contrast issues highlighted by the WAVE Validation Tool. It is my duty to address these in future updates to ensure an even higher level of accessibility across the entire platform. We appreciate the insights provided by the tool and will use this feedback to guide our ongoing improvements.

### PEP8
All Python files in the booking_sys and eaststreet apps, as well env.py and manage.py, have been passed through the [Code Institute PEP8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). The only warnings given were for the settings.py file which contains a small number of long lines (i.e. greater than 80 characters) under AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS; as this is code implemented by Django itself at setup, these lines will be left unchanged. 

### JSHint
The small JavaScript snippet under the footer of base.html has been passed through [JShint](https://jshint.com/) without issue.
